# stock-predict

Stock indicators and ways of calculating trend and profit come from this paper: 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405918815300179

Instead of the CEFLANN model the authors used, I experimented ensemble models including random forest, adaboost, and gradient boosting and stacking and blending to find the model that provide the highest profit for the stocks selected.

Results are contained in the notebooks in folder \models.
